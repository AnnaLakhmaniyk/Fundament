// Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

// 1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement 😅 (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'

// TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

// HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
// HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 😉

// GOOD LUCK 😀

// const bill = 430;
// const tip = bill <= 300 && bill >= 50 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
// console.log(
//   `The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value ${bill + tip}`
// );

// Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter)
// 1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and height (Mark Miller and John Smith)
// 2. Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same method on both objects). Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it from the method.
// 3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the respective BMI. Example: "John Smith's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark Miller's (23.9)!"
// TEST DATA: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.

// Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!
// 1. Create an array 'bills' containing all 10 test bill values
// 2. Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals ('tips' and 'totals')
// 3. Use the 'calcTip' function we wrote before (no need to repeat) to calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!
// TEST DATA: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86 and 52
// HINT: Call calcTip in the loop and use the push method to add values to the tips and totals arrays 😉
// 4. BONUS: Write a function 'calcAverage' which takes an array called 'arr' as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array. This is a DIFFICULT challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to solve it:
//   4.1. First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition, start by creating a variable 'sum' that starts at 0. Then loop over the array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the 'sum' variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values added together
//   4.2. To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the length of the array (because that's the number of elements)
//   4.3. Call the function with the 'totals' array

const bills = [22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, 52];
const tips = [];
const totals = [];

const calcTip = function (bill) {
  return bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
};

for (let i = 0; i < bills.length; i++) {
  const tip = calcTip(bills[i]);
  tips.push(tip);
  totals.push(tip + bills[i]);
}

console.log(bills, tips, totals);

const calcAverage = function (arr) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // sum = sum + arr[i];
    sum += arr[i];
  }
  return sum / arr.length;
};
console.log(calcAverage([2, 3, 7]));
console.log(calcAverage(totals));
console.log(calcAverage(tips));
